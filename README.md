# holberton-smiling-school-javascript

## In this project, we are finalizing our previous Bootstrap project (0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap)[https://github.com/tayloradam1999/holberton-smiling-school].  
  
### **ONE MAJOR NOTE**: As a cohort, my school never managed to get a multi-item carousel working the way our previous project was requiring, so our instructor has let us slide with using anything that will meet THIS project's task's requirements. ***FOR ME***, that means I have made the sections on all ```homepage.html``` files that include a multi-item carousel into a **SINGLE ITEM CAROUSEL.** 

### This project has us pulling in data with API's to use as dynamic data in place of our old static data. I went to each URL that we will be querying through and used ```cntrl-f``` to search for the amount of ID's each link held. Each section that requests us to use a *multi-item carousel* had a total of **SEVEN IDs**, so instead of a *multi-item carousel* with a total of *7 objects* to slide through, I have *single item carousels* that go through those same *7 objects*, as per task requirements.
